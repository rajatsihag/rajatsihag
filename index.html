                        This CodePen demonstrates how we can animate the opening and closing
                        states of an accordion with fancy reveal animation using only CSS. This
                        concept is suitable for creating <strong>FAQ sections</strong>,
                        <strong>Table of Contents</strong>, and more.

                        We cannot transition height or any CSS property from zero to auto. If we
                        want to smoothly expand a collapsed accordion, we could set a
                        <code>max-height</code> and transition the <code>height</code> property
                        to a large value when we expand the section. However,
                        if the content is larger than the <code>max-height</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, here we create a CSS grid with a grid item. Then we transition the
                        <code>grid-template-rows</code> property from <code>0fr</code> to
                        <code>1fr</code> and the grid item transitions to its content height.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I used CSS <code>clip-path</code> and <code>mix-blend-mode</code> to
                        animate the background and text color of the accordion. Each accordion
                        has two pseudo-elements. We know that <code>opacity</code>,
                        <code>clip-path</code> and, <code>visibility</code> are animatable CSS
                        properties. So when the accordion is selected using the
                        <code>:target</code> pseudo-class, we transition the clip-path circle
                        radius to 200% of the
                        <code>::before</code>
                        pseudo-element. When the accordion is not selected, we do the same with
                        the
                        <code>::after</code> but this time with a delay. This creates an
                        illusion as it appears to clip from inside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the accordion's title is an anchor element, users can also
                        navigate through the items with their keyboard.

                        In a recent video, Kevin showed us a way to animate height from zero to
                        auto value. Seeing that, I couldn't resist experimenting with the idea.
                        Then I came up with this CSS-only accordion component and added the
                        reveal animation too!

                        I would highly recommend watching
                        where he beautifully explains the technique and points out how he
                        discovered it. Also, read
                        and
                        on the same topic.
